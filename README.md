# Angelas-Authentication-course
In this small project I learnt some authentication features using encryption packages and user authentication on different stages.
this project is a good practice to understand the working of jason web tokens and encrypiting user passwords
and working with cookies. Setting cookie expiration date and checking the varidity of the cookie stored in the API response
to authenticate and authorize users and grant them different permissions according to their roles in the system.
